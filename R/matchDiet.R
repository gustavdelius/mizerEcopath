#' Match the diet matrix of the model to the Ecopath diet matrix
#'
#' This function adjusts the interaction matrix of the model so that its diet
#' matrix matches the Ecopath diet matrix. It then adjusts the external
#' encounter and mortality rates so that the steady state is not changed.
#'
#' The function will raise an error if negative external encounter rates are
#' required for any species and issues a warning for any species that requires
#' negative external mortality rates.
#'
#' Note that the function does not currently work properly when the mizer model
#' makes use of additional ecosystem components that add to the encounter rate.
#'
#' @section Centering:
#' Ecopath diet matrices often contain many zeros, which would mean that it is
#' impossible for two species to interact. This is because the Ecopath diet
#' matrix does not account for small prey items that do not contribute
#' significantly to a predator's diet. The `centering` parameter allows one to
#' experiment with adding an estimate of the diet of these small prey to the
#' diet matrix.
#'
#' For this purpose we assume that the Ecopath diet matrix did not account for
#' prey items with a weight below `w_cutoff`. To estimate their contribution to
#' the diet we make the assumption that for such small prey items the predator
#' does not distinguish between species and feeds solely according to its prey
#' size preference. We multiply the resulting encounter rate of these small
#' prey items by the `centering` argument and add it to the Ecopath diet matrix
#' before matching.
